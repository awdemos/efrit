# Efrit Performance Analysis

## Current Performance Metrics

### Local Operations (No API calls)
- Context capture: ~6ms for all sizes (100 chars to 100K chars)
  - This indicates efficient buffer handling
  - No scaling issues with buffer size
  
- Work log compression: ~5-6ms for all sizes (10 to 1000 items)
  - Linear scaling, very efficient
  - No bottlenecks in compression algorithm
  
- JSON parsing: 5-7ms (small to large)
  - Slight scaling with size but negligible
  - Native JSON parser is efficient

## Identified Performance Areas

### 1. API Latency (Primary Bottleneck)
- Network round-trip time dominates performance
- Typical API calls take 1-3 seconds
- Solution: Implement request batching and parallel processing

### 2. Memory Management
- Current issues:
  - Buffer leak in efrit-chat (fixed)
  - Session accumulation without cleanup
  - Work logs can grow unbounded
  
### 3. Session Protocol Overhead
- Multiple API calls for multi-step operations
- Each step requires full context transmission
- Solution: Implement session caching and delta updates

### 4. Queue Processing
- Currently processes one request at a time
- Could parallelize independent requests
- Solution: Implement concurrent queue processing

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Request Batching
```elisp
;; Bundle multiple tool calls into single API request
(defun efrit-async--batch-tools (tools)
  "Combine multiple tool calls into single request.")
```

### 2. Context Caching
```elisp
;; Cache context between related requests
(defvar efrit-context-cache (make-hash-table :test 'equal))
```

### 3. Lazy Loading
- Don't load all modules on startup
- Load on-demand based on usage

### 4. Response Streaming
- Process partial responses as they arrive
- Reduces perceived latency

### 5. Background Prefetching
- Predict likely next actions
- Prefetch common responses

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Fix memory leaks (DONE)
   - Implement session cleanup
   - Add request timeout handling
   
2. **Medium Priority**
   - Context caching between requests
   - Response streaming for long operations
   - Parallel queue processing
   
3. **Low Priority**
   - Request batching optimization
   - Background prefetching
   - Module lazy loading

## Benchmarking Plan

1. Create standardized test scenarios
2. Measure before/after each optimization
3. Track memory usage over time
4. Monitor API token consumption
