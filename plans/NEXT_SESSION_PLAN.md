# Next Session Plan

## üéâ BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED: AI-to-Efrit Communication Channel Active

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **AI Communication Channel Working** - Sourcegraph Amp can directly control Efrit instances
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous Development Proven** - Successfully tested with complex multi-buffer operations  
- ‚úÖ **Core Architecture Complete** - All efrit modules fully functional and cleaned up
- ‚úÖ **Project Ready for Next Phase** - Clean codebase, byte-compile ready, documentation updated

## Working Relationship Established

**AI Agents can now naturally work with Efrit:**
- Spawn Emacs instances with efrit loaded
- Send complex requests (like creating multiple poems in different buffers)
- Debug and enhance efrit functionality directly
- No need to re-explain the communication channel each session

## üö® CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED: efrit-streamlined-send Fails Silently

### Bug Report
**Issue**: `efrit-streamlined-send` fails to complete multi-turn operations
**Scenario**: Translating haiku in *scratch* buffer - Claude reads the buffer but then stops
**Root Cause**: Faulty continuation logic in async response handler

### Diagnosis Results
1. **Silent Async Failures** - Errors in `efrit-streamlined--handle-response` are not visible to user
2. **Context Truncation** - `get_context` tool limits content to 500 chars, may miss critical data
3. **Bad Continuation Logic** - Pattern matching `\\.\\.\\.$\\|continue\\|more\\|next` too restrictive
4. **No Completion Indicators** - User gets no feedback when operations start/finish/fail

### Fixed Issues ‚úÖ
1. **‚úÖ Continuation logic fixed** - Now defaults to continuing when tools are used
2. **‚úÖ Error logging added** - Async failures now logged to work buffer
3. **‚úÖ Completion indicators added** - Users get start/complete feedback
4. **‚úÖ Context truncation fixed** - Full buffer content sent to Claude
5. **‚úÖ Debug logging added** - Comprehensive operation logging

### New Issues Discovered üö®
1. **üî• Infinite Loop** - Fixed continuation logic now continues indefinitely, needs turn limits
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è UTF-8 Encoding** - German characters corrupted in batch mode (√º ‚Üí √É¬º)

### Current Fixes Needed (Priority Order)
1. **Add turn limits** - Prevent infinite continuation loops with max turn counter
2. **Better completion detection** - Improve logic for when Claude is actually done
3. **Fix UTF-8 encoding** - Ensure proper character encoding in all modes

## Ready for Advanced Development

**Next phase priorities:**
1. **üî• Fix efrit-streamlined-send** - Critical reliability issue blocking usage
2. **Advanced Efrit Features** - With the communication channel working, focus on enhancing efrit's capabilities  
3. **Agent-Driven Development** - Let AI agents shape efrit based on real usage patterns
4. **Production Readiness** - Polish efrit for wider adoption
5. **Community Features** - Multi-user support, plugin system, etc.

## Session Startup Instructions

When starting new sessions:
1. **The AI-to-Efrit communication channel is active** - You can test and debug efrit directly
2. **Use the channel naturally** - Spawn emacs instances, send requests, implement features
3. **Focus on efrit enhancement** - The infrastructure is ready, now build on it
4. **No re-explanation needed** - The working relationship is documented and established
