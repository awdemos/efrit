# Next Session Plan

## ðŸŽ‰ BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED: AI-to-Efrit Communication Channel Active

### Current Status
- âœ… **AI Communication Channel Working** - Sourcegraph Amp can directly control Efrit instances
- âœ… **Autonomous Development Proven** - Successfully tested with complex multi-buffer operations  
- âœ… **Core Architecture Complete** - All efrit modules fully functional and cleaned up
- âœ… **Project Ready for Next Phase** - Clean codebase, byte-compile ready, documentation updated

## Working Relationship Established

**AI Agents can now naturally work with Efrit:**
- Spawn Emacs instances with efrit loaded
- Send complex requests (like creating multiple poems in different buffers)
- Debug and enhance efrit functionality directly
- No need to re-explain the communication channel each session

## Ready for Advanced Development

**Next phase priorities:**
1. **Advanced Efrit Features** - With the communication channel working, focus on enhancing efrit's capabilities
2. **Agent-Driven Development** - Let AI agents shape efrit based on real usage patterns
3. **Production Readiness** - Polish efrit for wider adoption
4. **Community Features** - Multi-user support, plugin system, etc.

## Session Startup Instructions

When starting new sessions:
1. **The AI-to-Efrit communication channel is active** - You can test and debug efrit directly
2. **Use the channel naturally** - Spawn emacs instances, send requests, implement features
3. **Focus on efrit enhancement** - The infrastructure is ready, now build on it
4. **No re-explanation needed** - The working relationship is documented and established
